Microsoft employee here. I've got a large customer trying to figure out why 1809, a version no longer receiving updates, is the last version of Windows to be FIPS 140-2 certified. I managed to find a document from NIST with a later version of Windows (https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/documents/security-policies/140sp3923.pdf), but the customer needs to know which newer versions are validated.
