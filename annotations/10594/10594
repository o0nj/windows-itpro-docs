There is no mention of Windows 11 under "Applies to:" in the WHfB FAQ page.
Therefore, we request the addition of information regarding Winodws 11.

For example, this page has information on Windows 11 under "Applies to".
If possible, to reassure users, it would be helpful if you could add information on Windows 11, as shown here.
