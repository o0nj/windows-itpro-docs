Hi!

This page is referenced from the HoloLens 2 documentation (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens/hololens-network) in regard to setting per-wifi-profile proxy settings:

[WiFi CSP](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/client-management/mdm/wifi-csp): per-profile Wi-Fi proxy

However the mentions of proxy settings on this page don't give any useful information, just statements like:

"Proxy Don't use. Using this configuration in Windows 10 client editions will result in failure."
"Using Proxyis in Windows 10 client editions (Home, Pro, Enterprise, and Education) will result in failure."

I believe this CSP is still in use / relevant to HoloLens / Windows Holographic, which seems to use per-connection proxy setting (at least it's available in the UI), but without the documentation it's impossible to use.
