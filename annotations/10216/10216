Hi.

This is rather lenghty article so there may be more suggestions to come, but quite early on, in the section **Verify the onPremisesDistinguishedName attribute is synchronized** I noticed an example of how to check for the aforementioned AD-synched user attribute using the soon-to-be deprecated Azure AD Graph Explorer (and web app https://graph.azurewebsites.net)!

I verified that the query can be made in the Microsoft Graph web app (https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/graph-explorer).

Therefore I would like to suggest replacing the example with a Microsoft Graph one.
If using the v1.0 endpoint (as examples look best when using production ready endpoints) perhaps use the following query:

- https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/[userid]?$select=displayName,id,givenName,surname,onPremisesDistinguishedName

Or, for convenience and complete output of user attributes, similar to the Azure AD Graph Explore example, use beta endpoint:

- https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/users/[userid]

Thanks for allowing feedback to the documentation to help us help you keep it up to date!

Kind regards,

\-TIm Peter
