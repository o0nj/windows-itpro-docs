from the documentation:

> " CreateProcess calls AppCompat, Fusion, and Installer detection to assess ..."

we can see there are 3 things that can trigger UAC prompt:
1. App compatibility settings
2. Fusion,  the application manifest
3. Installer Detection Technology

a. is there different priority levels to process 3 settings above? 
b. if the application manifest overrides other settings, Why is an executable ran from standard user requesting for Elevation prompt when its manifest specifys asInvoker?
 I know this is not tech support, but if only you could make the documentation clearer about this,   hundreds of thousand of developers, admins could benefit from it.
