Please note that current certificate for SetupDiag.exe v1.6.2107.27002 has already expired on 12/02/2021.
Unless you're going to provide another update of same tool I hope that at least you can soon just ensure that same tool it's published again with a non expired yet certificate.
Thanks for attention.
Best Regards
