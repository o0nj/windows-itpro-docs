Purely a suggestion. Step 4 (right clicking Group Policy Objects and selecting Paste) was tripping me up - as you need to know exactly where and what to click. The rest of the copy process is easy!

I'm guessing others get stuck here too, as when you click "Copy", nothing appears to happen. Anyways a screenshot like below was all I needed:
