This page says

Device Credential is only supported for Microsoft Intune enrollment in scenarios with Co-management or **Azure Virtual Desktop because the Intune subscription is user centric.**

What does this even mean? I have a Windows 10 21H2 AVD Personal, Hybrid Joined without SCCM and trying to auto-enrol into Intune and Device Credential is not working. Is Device Credential the option to allow the device to enroll before a user signs in?
