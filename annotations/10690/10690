The DisableCatchUpFullScan and DisableCatchUpQuickScan descriptions do not match up with the policy's actual implementation which is confusing.  In the description both state: "If you enable this setting, catch-up scans for scheduled full scans will be turned on." and "If you enable this setting, catch-up scans for scheduled quick scans will be turned on." If Enabled when you check result from the Get-MpPreferences you will see that the value shows as 'False'.  If disabled the result from Get-MpPreferences is 'True'.  While these are the right values, because Enable = 0 (false) and Disable = 1 (true), the descriptions and validation are very confusing and make understanding these policies difficult.

Request adding clarification of the setting to so that it is easier to map this from the Management Surface -> CSP -> Endpoint result.
