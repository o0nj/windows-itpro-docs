Modules used by Windows - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/fips-140-validation#modules-used-by-windows seems to stop at 1809, leading customer to questions if newer versions of Windows are still covered.

Do we plan to update this page? What can be done to ensure customers that newer versions of Windows are compliant. This is slowing the sales cycle for several accounts.

thanks,
