Verify if these are 'and' or 'or' statements

The hybrid deployment model is for organizations that:

- Are federated with Azure Active Directory (or/and;?)
- Have identities synchronized to Azure Active Directory using Azure Active Directory Connect (or/and;?)
- Use applications hosted in Azure Active Directory, and want a single sign-in user experience for both on-premises and Azure Active Directory resources (or/and;?)

i.e. are they mutually exclusive or all three need to be in place to be able to implement the hybrid deployment model?
