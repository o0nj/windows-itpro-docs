By default the block rules allows all files. The specifics around deployment of this policy aren't specified in this page. For example, if you Merge-CIPolicy this policy into another policy--and don't really check what's going on, you'll actually "Allow All" files inadvertently. This caused me a little confusion as to why my WDAC log wasn't firing when I executed Putty.
