> Although the TPM owner password is not retained starting with Windows 10, version 1607, or Windows 11, you can change a default registry key to retain it. ... set the registry key 'HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\TPM' [REG_DWORD] 'OSManagedAuthLevel' to 4.

I set the registry on a Windows 11 laptop and used tpm.msc to clear the TPM, then restarted the machine.

> With Windows 10, version 1507 or 1511, or Windows 11, if you have opted specifically to preserve the TPM owner password, you can use the saved password to change to a new password.
> To change to a new TPM owner password, in TPM.msc, click Change Owner Password

The "Change Owner Password" option is not present.
