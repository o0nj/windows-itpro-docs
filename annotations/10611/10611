Hello,

I feel this article is unclear in the options it gives for GPO to auto enroll devices in Intune.

There are two options, device and user credential. 

The writer says "Use user credential for devices 1903 and later" but then says "Device Credential is a new option for 1903 PCs, used only in the case of Co-Management". 

It's as if to say, Device Credential is available as a feature for 1903 PCs, but don't use it. I assume that's because it needs co-management with SCCM, but even that is unclear, because otherwise why does the article say, "Use user credential" for ALL devices 1903 and later?

Also, it is unclear what the differences between Device Credential and User credential enrollments are. I am having trouble finding any information about this, anywhere. Please clarify what each option is and does, and for what scenarios. 

See the attached picture with snip it highlights for an example of the unclear language. Thank you!
