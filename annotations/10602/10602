Hi 

we see "preview mode" in the title but there is no explanation to what it is. 

1. What preview mode means exactly? Shouldn't we start using? 
2. What are the cons if we adopt something in preview mode? 
3. when preview will end?  I wouldn't care to adopt solution if there is a defined date and if it's close.

The real problem here is the Microsoft wizard in admin panel suggests to adopt cloud trust model but this wizard is not aware of preview mode. 

if it's preview, microsoft shouldn't suggest to use it as an option. 

we have requested cloud trust setup from our vendor and they rejected with the excuse of preview mode and adopted old fashion method.
