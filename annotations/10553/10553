### The tooltip for Defender Catch-Up settings are currently directly opposing the name of the setting.

The policy name is "Disable Catch-Up Scans" however the tooltip and documentation suggest that the correct setting for "Catch-Up Scans" to be enabled, would be "Yes" which is directly opposing what the name of the policy is. 

For example: 
DisableCatchupFullScan = Yes (**according to docs, this means they are NOT disabled**)

This also appears in the documentation listed here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-defender#defender-disablecatchupfullscan

```
This policy setting allows you to configure catch-up scans for scheduled full scans. A catch-up scan is a scan that is initiated because a regularly scheduled scan was missed. Usually these scheduled scans are missed because the computer was turned off at the scheduled time.

If you enable this setting, catch-up scans for scheduled full scans will be turned on. If a computer is offline for two consecutive scheduled scans, a catch-up scan is started the next time someone signs in to the computer. If there's no scheduled scan configured, there will be no catch-up scan run.

If you disable or don't configure this setting, catch-up scans for scheduled full scans will be turned off.
