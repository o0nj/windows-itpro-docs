The tree format listing of SurfaceHub CSP management objects (at the top of this page) lists the following objects:

----Management
--------GroupName
--------GroupSid

However, there is no corresponding information on them throughout the rest of the page.

Are these settings deprecated and should be removed from the tree view? Or are they valid and should have corresponding description and configuration details included on the page?
