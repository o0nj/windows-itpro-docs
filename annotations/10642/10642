For this... "Windows uses facial recognition to authenticate the RDP session to the Windows Server 2016 Hyper-V server. You can continue to use Windows Hello for Business in the remote session, but you must use your PIN."
If it automatically uses facial recognition to authenticate the RDP session, then how do instead use my Hello for Business PIN? 
There was no mention of an OS until this note - "Windows Server 2016 Hyper-V computer".  Is Svr2016 a minimum requirement? AND it specifically stated Hyper-V... is that also a requirement?  This should be pointed out as a requirement, not as a side-note for a side-note.
