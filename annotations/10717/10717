The content of this page was lacking some entries as described in https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/windows-itpro-docs/issues/10026
It was fixed by https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/windows-itpro-docs/pull/10225

However, the new content was not added to the table of contents https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/windows-itpro-docs/blob/9c545726726211c813844676e80fa1bf5fbe99ef/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/special-identities.md?plain=1#L38-L86

For example, but not limited to, "Attested Key Property" was [added](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/special-identities#attested-key-property) but it's missing from the table of contents list.
